Bright Network doubleclick tags
=========================

All of the tags (header and body) for each page are named in a .html file for that page template.

The configuration.txt file indicates which tags go on which page and which .html file contains the tags. 

Because doubleclick generates header and body tags together it is important to use the correct and header and body tags on the correct page template otherwise the ads won't render.
